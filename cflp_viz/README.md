# Solution visualization

## Installation

Set the visualization directory as the current working directory and run the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may exit the virtual environment by running the command `deactivate`.

## Usage

Make sure to have the virtual environment activated. Use the following command to start the Jupyter server:
```
jupyter notebook
```

The command starts a local application server. Open the Jupyter notebook __visualization.ipynb__ in the browser interface 
and visualize your solutions based on the instructions in the notebook.
